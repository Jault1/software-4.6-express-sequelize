## Assignment

### Brief

Create the end-to-end flow for items. The routes for items would be as follows:
- Get all items (optional: display items with category names instead of category id)
- Retrieve a single item (optional: display items with category names instead of category id)
- Create a new item 
- Update an item 
- Delete an item

Make sure data validation is present (especially for creating and updating entries) before writing data in the database.

Challenge: Create a new route for categories for GET /:id/items that lists all the items belonging to a single category.
